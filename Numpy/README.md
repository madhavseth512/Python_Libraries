## Numpy

NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python.<br>
Here is a breakdown of what numpy brings to the table -<br>

- **Multidimensional arrays:** NumPy's core data structure is the ndarray, a powerful n-dimensional array object.
- **Mathematical functions:** NumPy provides a comprehensive collection of mathematical functions that operate on entire arrays at once.
- **Linear algebra functions:** Linear algebra operations like matrix multiplication, eigendecomposition, and solving linear systems are all efficiently handled by NumPy's linear algebra submodule.
- **Basic statistical operations:** NumPy offers functions for common statistical operations like calculating means, standard deviations, and percentiles on large datasets.

There are also too much faster than python lists because of many reasons like list do not consists of single type of data, thus no type checking when iterating through objects and 
also numpy uses contiguous blocks of memory unlike lists.<br>

## Pandas 
Pandas is a popular Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.<br>
Some the areas where it is used is - <br>

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Cleaning and preperation of data is done using pandas. You can handle missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues with ease
- **Data Exploration and Analysis:** You can sort, filter, group data, and calculate summary statistics to gain insights from your dataset.
<br>

Many more other things can be done using Pandas.
